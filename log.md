**Today's Progress**: Created a small REST "Hello World" Web App

**Thoughts:** It looked challenging at the start but really it was a great learning when I digged into it, I got to know how we can leverage the rich golang libraries, I came to know more about the "net/http" package in this exercise.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
